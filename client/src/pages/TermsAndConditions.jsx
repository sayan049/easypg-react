      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Messmate. By using our platform, you agree to comply with
        these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before
        proceeding.
      </p>

      <div className="prose prose-sm text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <h3 className="font-semibold">1. Platform Usage</h3>
        <p>
          By using MessMate, you acknowledge that we are a platform that helps
          users discover nearby mess accommodations. We do not charge any fees
          for using the service and do not facilitate bookings or transactions.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">2. Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>
          MessMate does not handle payments or deposits. All financial
          transactions are to be made directly between users and property
          owners. We do not charge any service or gateway fees.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">3. Rental Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          Users are advised to enter into a written rental agreement with the
          mess owner before making any payments. MessMate is not a party to such
          agreements and does not mediate or enforce any terms.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">4. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          As MessMate does not process payments, we do not offer or handle
          refunds. Any security deposit or payment-related refunds must be
          addressed with the mess owner directly.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">5. Legal Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          MessMate is a location discovery service. All legal and financial
          responsibilities rest with the tenant and the property owner. Users
          are encouraged to verify property documents and meet owners in person
          before making commitments.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">6. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          For disputes involving mess listings or agreements, users must resolve
          issues directly with the property owner. MessMate may assist with
          contact details but is not liable for any outcomes. Legal recourse may
          be pursued under applicable Indian consumer protection laws.
